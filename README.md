## Usage

1. **Deploy it to Heroku** <br>[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. **Find the secret:** In your new Heroku app go to Settings → Config Variables → Reveal Config Variables, and copy the `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` variable value.

3. **Set up the webhook:** In Buildkite go to Settings → Notifications → Webhooks and add a new webhook pointing to your new Heroku app (don’t forget to choose the project and branch name). The token should be the one generated by Heroku, which you can find in your Heroku project’s environment variables.

4. **Trigger a build!** :tada:

## Personalising

One bulb per project? One bulb per build pipeline step? A LIFX chandelier that twinkles rainbows after each deploy? The possibilities are endless!
